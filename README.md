# Java_Recursion
three recursive functions
## Project Description
1. The **removeRepeated** function is a static method designed to process a given string and return a new string with consecutive repeated characters removed.
2. The **sizeDiff** function is a static method designed to calculate the difference between the length of a stack and a given integer. This function operates using recursion while ensuring that the original stack remains unchanged.
3. The **sumProdAdj** function is a static method designed to calculate the sum of the product of adjacent pairs of integers in a given stack of integers.  If the number of elements in the stack is odd, the bottom element is ignored in the calculation.
